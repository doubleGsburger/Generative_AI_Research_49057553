Generative_AI_Research_[49057553]
Overview
Welcome to the Generative AI Research project repository! This repository serves as the central hub for all research materials, code, data, and collaborative documents generated during our study on the impact and utility of generative AI tools. Our goal is to efficiently share resources, discuss innovative ideas, and ensure a seamless workflow through strong team collaboration.

Team Collaboration
Our project thrives on the collective input of each team member. We believe that open communication and shared responsibility are key to producing quality research. Here are some of the guiding principles for our collaboration:

Open Communication: We use GitHub Issues and pull requests for continuous communication regarding project updates, ideas, and any areas needing improvement.

Clear Responsibilities: Each team member is assigned specific tasks and responsibilities to ensure that all aspects of the project are covered, from data collection and analysis to documentation and presentation.

Regular Updates: Team meetings are held weekly to review progress, discuss challenges, and plan for upcoming tasks. Ensure you keep your local repository up-to-date with regular commits.

Feedback and Support: Constructive feedback is always welcomed. We value every team memberâ€™s insights and encourage supporting one another to overcome challenges.

Data Sharing
Sharing data efficiently is crucial for the success of our project. To ensure our data is accessible and well-managed, we adhere to the following guidelines:

Centralized Repository: All research data, including literature reviews, quantitative survey data, qualitative interview transcripts, and analysis scripts, is organized into dedicated folders for easy access.

Version Control: We employ Git for version control to track changes across all files. Meaningful commit messages help everyone understand the evolution of our work.

Data Security: Sensitive information is handled with strict access controls and stored securely. Personal data and confidential documents have restricted access to protect privacy and integrity.

Documentation: Each folder contains a README file that explains its contents, file naming conventions, and how the data was collected or generated.

Collaboration Tools: We use GitHub Issues for task tracking and project management to ensure that every team member is informed about updates and requirements.
